## OAuth 2.0 server written in node.js

This is a very trivial implementation of oauth 2.0 server that implements Authorization code grant flow for regular web applications as specified in [RFC 6749 section 1.3.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1).

_Not to be used in production_ This is just for self-learning and getting deeper understanding of oauth protocol.

Also this was implemented as a part of a hands-on workshop conducted by [@thameera](http://github.com/thameera)
